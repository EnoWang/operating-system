# Background

Processes can execute concurrently

- May be interrupted at any time, partially completing execution

Concurrent access to shared data may result in data inconsistency

Maintaining data consistency requires mechanisms to ensure the orderly execution of cooperating processes

## Illustration of the problem

Suppose that we wanted to provide a solution to the consumer-producer problem that fills all the buffers (**bounded buffer**). We can do so by having an integer counter that keeps track of the number of full buffers.

Initially, counter is set to 0. It is incremented by the producer after it produces a new buffer and is decremented by the consumer after it consumes a buffer.

## Producer

```c
while (true) {	/* produce an item in next produced */

	while (counter == BUFFER_SIZE) ;
		/* do nothing */
	buffer[in] = next_produced;
	in = (in + 1) % BUFFER_SIZE;
	counter++;
}
```

## Consumer

```c
while (true) {
	while (counter == 0)
		; /* do nothing */
	next_consumed = buffer[out];
	out = (out + 1) % BUFFER_SIZE;
        counter--;
	/* consume the item in next consumed */
}
```

#### Above producer and consumer may not funtion correctly when executed concurrently

## Race Condition

Several processes access and manipulate the same data concurrently and the outcome of the execution depends on particular order in which the access take place

### counter++ could be implemented as

```c
register1 = counter
register1 = register1 + 1
counter = register1
```

### counter-- could be implemented as

```c
register2 = counter
register2 = register2 - 1
counter = register2
```

### One interleaving example

S0: producer execute register1 = counter (register1 = 5)

S1: producer execute register1 = register1 + 1 (register1 = 6)

S2: consumer execute register2 = counter (register2 = 5)

S3: consumer execute register2 = register2 â€“ 1 (register2 = 4)

S4: producer execute counter = register1 (counter = 6)

S5: consumer execute counter = register2 (counter = 4)
