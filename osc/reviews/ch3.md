**3.1** Using the program shown in Figure 3.30, explain what the output will be at LINE A.

```c
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int value = 5;
int main()
{
    pid t pid;
    pid = fork();
    if (pid == 0) { /* child process */
        value += 15;
        return 0;
    }
    else if (pid > 0) { /* parent process */
        wait(NULL);
        printf("PARENT: value = %d",value); /* LINE A */
        return 0;
    }
}
```

    fork();
    /* fork another child process */
